\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation and Background}

\textbf{Motivations for having Data Visualisations - Case Example 1}\\

\noindent
Florence Nightingale was not only a social reformer and the founder of modern nursing but also a pioneering statistician. It was her application of data visualisation during the Crimean War that transformed the field of healthcare and pushed for social reform.\\  

\noindent
During the Crimean War, Nightingale recognised that unsanitary hospital conditions were claiming more lives than the battlefield itself. With the help of William Farr, Nightingale created the coxcomb aimed to illustrate the toll of preventable mortality on soldiers, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:coxcomb}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Nightingale-mortality.jpg}
    \caption{``Diagram of the causes of mortality in the army in the East", in 1858 by Florence Nightingale\cite{wikiFN}}
    \label{fig:coxcomb}
\end{figure}

\noindent 
The coxcomb, resembling an unconventional pie chart, partitioned mortality by causes. Blue indicates preventable deaths, red indicates deaths by wounds, and black indicates other causes.
The blue areas outweighed the red and black sections combined, highlighting the disproportionate impact of unsanitary hospital conditions on the mortality rate.\\

\noindent
Nightingale leveraged the compelling visualisations in her advocacy efforts, presenting them to MPs and government officials who otherwise are unlikely to read or understand statistical reports. Nightingale successfully persuaded Queen Victoria, head of the British Army at the time, to allocate funding for the improvement of better conditions in military hospitals.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Motivations for having Data Visualisations - Case Example 2}\\

\noindent
Sometimes, one glance is enough to convey the most powerful idea. Edward Hawkins, a British climate scientist and Professor of climate science at the University of Reading, is renowned for his exceptional datavisualisations of climate change.\\

\noindent
In 2018, Edward Hawkins was invited to deliver a lecture on climate change in Wales to an audience with diverse backgrounds. It was important to effectively convey the growing urgency surrounding global warming. To achieve this, he created a chart that used just colours, without any words, titles, or legends, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:global}. This seemingly simple yet remarkably powerful chart visually illustrated the Earth's warming trend since 1850.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{global.png}
    \caption{``Latest global stripes (1850-2020)", by Edward Hawkins\cite{blog}}
    \label{fig:global}
\end{figure}

\noindent 
Known as the ``warming stripes," this chart cleverly employs blues to indicate cooler-than-average years and reds to signify hotter-than-average years. Its influence reached far and wide, gracing the front pages of major media outlets and featured in news broadcasts worldwide. It became a symbol in climate change demonstrations. Arguably, it stands as one of the most iconic graphics in modern times.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Misuses of Data Visualisation - Case Example 1}\\

\noindent
Inappropriate datavisualisation conceals trends rather than revealing them. Figure~\ref{fig:misuse1} illustrates an instance of this issue. On the left-hand side, an inappropriate scale was used --- the y-scale ranging from 0 to 30 million dollars, obscuring the fluctuations in payroll spending. Conversely, on the right-hand side, observe that there's a significant increase of over 500,000 dollars in just two months. This revelation is substantial; considering inflation, 500,000 dollars in 1937 is worth well over 10 million dollars today\cite{worth}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{misuse1.png}
    \caption{Inappropriate use of data visualisation\cite{lie}}
    \label{fig:misuse1}
\end{figure}

\noindent 
\textbf{Misuses of Data Visualisation - Case Example 2}\\

\noindent
Data visualisation can be misused, leading to disastrous consequences. One striking example of such misuse is found in the Kallikak Family tree, which was one of the most prominent eugenic narratives of the 20th century.\\

\noindent
The visualisation (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:familytree}) was created by the psychologist Henry Goddard and presented in his 1912 book, ``The Kallikak Family: A Study in the Heredity of Feeble-Mindedness." Goddard's narrative centered around Martin Kallikak, a soldier who, in addition to his marriage to a respected citizen, had a one-night stand with a ``feeble-minded" maid. Goddard believed that intellectual disabilities were inherited traits. In Goddard's account, the legitimate family was successful, while the children of the ``feeble-minded" maid were labeled as ``the lowest types of human beings." However, research has since revealed that the entire story was fictitious, as there was no record of the maid's existence\cite{fakedata}.\\

\noindent
Regrettably, the Kallikak family tree became a central element in the eugenics movement for decades afterward. Figure \ref{fig:familytree} was featured in the 1935 Nazi propaganda film ``Das Erbe" (The Inheritance), which was used to promote public acceptance of Nazi eugenics laws. This propaganda laid the groundwork for the forced sterilization of approximately 400,000 people under Nazi eugenics policies \cite{eugenics}.

\subsection{Computing and Data Visualisation}

In data visualisation, we mostly use ggplot as our useful tool to create so many greaet plots to represent our dataset. ggplot2 is based on the Grammar of Graphics, which simply means that you can draw each part of the graph first, and then add the parts together to form a complete graph.\\

\noindent
As we will explore in subsequent sections, we can achieve numerous visualisations effortlessly by utilizing data in R together with ggplot.
When using ggplot2, the following objects are used repeatedly, Such as geom, scale, coord, aes, stat, theme labs and so on.\\

\noindent
\textbf{\textit{``ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis''}} is a book written by Hadley Wickham, focused on teaching the use of the ggplot2 package in R for datavisualisation. The book thoroughly covers the principles, usage, and advanced techniques of ggplot2, making it an essential resource for learning and mastering this tool.\\

\noindent
\textbf{geom} refers to Geometric Objects. Geometric objects are key components of ggplot2 and are used to define how data is visually represented in a plot. Each geom function corresponds to a specific type of graphical representation in a chart.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Scales} map data to the aesthetic attributes of a graphic, such as color, size, and shape. In ggplot2, scale functions allow you to adjust the details of these mappings, such as the choice of colors, the format of labels, the layout of legends, and more.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Chord} talks about how data coordinates are mapped to the plane of the graphic. It provdes axis and gridlines to make it possible to read the graph. We can use Cartesian coordinate system, polar coordinates and map projections and so on.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Faceting} is a powerful feature that allows you to split one plot into multiple plots based on a factor (or factors) included in the dataset. This is particularly useful for exploring and presenting data that has multiple groups or categories.\\

\noindent
The \textbf{theme} function plays a crucial role in customizing the non-data components of your plots. The theme system in ggplot2 allows you to fine-tune the aesthetic details of your plot, such as fonts, labels, legends, and background colors. It is an essential tool for making your plots more readable and for creating visually appealing graphics that can be tailored to specific audiences or publication requirements.

\subsection{Datasets}
In this section, we unveil the datasets used throughout our study. This section delves into the comprehensive depiction of the diverse datasets employed. Each dataset is meticulously introduced, elucidating its source, structure, and relevance to our investigation.\\

\section{Theoretical Foundations of Data Visualisation}
This chapter, ``Theoretical Foundations of Data Visualisation," delves into the core principles and concepts that serve as the base of this field. We seek to understand not only the ``how" but also the ``why" behind the creation of visualisations that captivate and inform.

\subsection{Introduction to Data Visualisation Theory}
Creating effective data visualisations requires a robust theoretical framework underlying every chart, graph, or plot. These theoretical underpinnings not only form the basis of data visualisation but also influence how we represent, perceive, understand, and interpret data.\\ 

\noindent \textbf{Guiding Principles for Data Representation}\\
The theoretical framework of data visualisation involves guiding principles dictating visual representation of data. These principles include \textbf{accuracy}, emphasizing faithful reflection of underlying data to reduce distortion or misinterpretation; \textbf{simplicity}, advocating for streamlined visuals to convey information effectively; \textbf{clarity}, ensuring visuals are easily understood without unnecessary complexity; \textbf{relevance}, presenting information pertinent to the message or question addressed; and \textbf{consistency}, maintaining uniform use of visual elements like color coding and labeling throughout a visualisation.\\

\end{figure}


\noindent \textbf{Theoretical Framework and Visual Perception}\\
Understanding how the human brain processes visual information is a fundamental aspect of data visualisation theory. This knowledge plays a crucial role in designing visualisations that effectively connect with viewers. It encompasses several key considerations which will be studied in order: the Gestalt Principles, which encompass proximity, similarity, and continuity, affecting how visual elements are grouped and interpreted; Color Theory, involving the strategic use of color contrasts and harmonies to improve clarity and impact; and the management of Cognitive Load, which emphasises the importance of reducing mental effort needed to process information.\\


\subsection{Data Types and Visualisation Techniques}
To have a discussion about data representation, understanding the nature of the data is key. Data comes in various types, and selecting the appropriate visualisation technique is contingent upon recognising these distinctions. In this section, the data types are categorised and matched with their suitable visualisation techniques.

\subsubsection{Categorisation of Data Types}
Data types can be broadly categorised into four main types: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Nominal data}: represents categories or labels without any inherent order. Examples include colours, gender categories, and city names. 
    \item \textbf{Ordinal data}: implies a meaningful order or ranking among categories but lacks equal intervals between them. Examples include survey responses (eg. “very satisfied”, “satisfied”, “neutral”, “dissatisfied”, “very dissatisfied”)
    \item \textbf{Interval data}: possesses ordered categories with equal intervals between them, but it lacks a true zero point. Temperature is measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit as an example. 
    \item \textbf{Ratio data}: includes ordered categories with equal intervals and a meaningful zero point. Examples are age, income, and weight. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Matching Data Types with Appropriate Visualisation Techniques}
Selecting appropriate visualisation techniques is essential for effective data communication. Various data types demand specific visualisation methods for optimal representation. For \textbf{nominal data}, bar charts and stacked bar charts are effective in displaying categorical information and relative proportions. \textbf{Ordinal data} benefits from ordered bar charts, dot plots, or stacked bar charts, maintaining the ranking and order of categories. \textbf{Interval data} is best visualised using line charts, histograms, and box plots, showcasing trends and distributions without assuming a true zero point. \textbf{Ratio data} finds effective representation through scatter plots, histograms, and line charts, enabling precise comparisons and measurements due to the presence of a meaningful zero point.

}

\caption[Different types of visualisation according to the data type used]{Different types of visualisation according to the data type used}\label{fig:data-plots}
\end{figure}

\end{knitrout}


\subsection{Data Abstraction and Representation}
The transformation of raw data into meaningful representations is a pivotal step in data representation. This process, known as data abstraction, involves distilling complex datasets into visual forms that convey insights. In this section, we explore data abstraction, the hierarchies and levels of abstraction in data visualisation, and the critical trade-offs between abstraction and the potential loss of information.

\subsubsection{Data Abstraction: Transforming Raw Data}
Data abstraction involves simplifying and structuring raw data into comprehensible and insightful formats. This process serves as the bridge, transforming numbers, text, and variables into visual elements that convey patterns, trends, and relationships, forming the core of informative data visualisations.

\subsubsection{Hierarchies and Levels of Abstraction}
Abstraction operates on multiple levels of granularity. Hierarchies of abstraction allow us to represent data at varying levels of detail: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Low-Level Abstraction}: At the lowest level, raw data is preserved in its most detailed form. This might include individual data points, measurements, or unprocessed text.
    \item \textbf{Mid-Level Abstraction}: At the mid-level, data is grouped or aggregated to provide a broader overview. For example, hourly data points may be aggregated into daily or weekly averages.
    \item \textbf{High-Level Abstraction}: At the highest level, data is represented in a condensed and abstracted form, often as summary statistics or key insights. This level provides a big-picture view.
\end{enumerate}

These are represented in Figure~\ref{fig:abs-plots}. The first visualisations of the mtcars dataset is a scatter plot that provides detailed information about the relationship between car weight and miles per gallon, with points colored by the number of cylinders. The second is an abstract visualisation using a box-and-whisker plot to provide a high-level summary of the distribution of miles per gallon for different numbers of cylinders. Finally, the third visualisation is a bar plot presenting aggregated information about the average miles per gallon for different numbers of cylinders.

\begin{knitrout}\scriptsize
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\maxwidth]{figure/beamer-abs-plots-1} 

}

\caption[Mtcars dataset visualised on 3 different levels of abstraction]{Mtcars dataset visualised on 3 different levels of abstraction}\label{fig:abs-plots}
\end{figure}

\end{knitrout}

\noindent \textbf{Trade-offs Between Abstraction and Information Loss}\\
While abstraction simplifies complex data, it presents trade-offs. Designers of data visualisation must strike a balance between clarity and detail, generalisation and specificity, and context versus precision. Abstraction increases clarity but may sacrifice crucial detailed information necessary for some analytical tasks. It offers a more generalised view accessible to a wider audience but might overlook specific nuances essential for experts. While providing valuable context, high-level abstraction may lack the precision required for precise decision-making.\\ 

In data visualisation, the art of data abstraction lies in finding the right level of detail that effectively conveys the intended message while minimising the risk of information loss. This balancing act is a critical consideration in the design of informative and meaningful data visualisations.

\subsection{Visual Perception and Cognition}
In this first section, human visual perception is explored, along with the application of cognitive psychology principles in data visualisation.\\ 

\noindent \textbf{Human Visual Perception: Decoding Visual Information}\\
Human visual perception profoundly influences our understanding of the surrounding world. When applied to data visualisation, it shapes the way that individuals engage with and derive meaning from visual data representations.\\

Significant aspects of human visual perception within data visualisation encompass \textbf{pattern recognition}, adept at identifying trends, outliers, and relationships in data representations. Additionally, \textbf{perceptual grouping}, where visually similar elements are grouped together, influences the interpretation of data clusters and shapes. Moreover, the \textbf{hierarchy of perception} dictates that certain visual attributes are processed more swiftly and effectively than others, such as color being processed faster than text, influencing the viewer's attention hierarchy.

\subsubsection{The Gestalt Principles}
Furthermore, the Gestalt Principles XXXCITEXXX play an important role in the realm of visual perception and design. Key Gestalt principles crucial in shaping visual information perception include proximity, which groups related elements, \textbf{similarity} that links similar attributes, \textbf{continuity} aiding trend representation, \textbf{closure} for implying connections, and \textbf{symmetry} for balance and aesthetics in visualisations.\\

By harnessing the principles of human visual perception, applying insights from cognitive psychology, and leveraging pre-attentive attributes, data visualisation designers can create visualisations that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also cognitively efficient.	


\subsection{Colour Theory in Data Visualisation}
In this section, the significance of colour in data visualisation, the principles of colour perception and encoding, and the importance of avoiding misleading visualisations through thoughtful colour choices are explored.\\

\noindent \textbf{The Importance of Colour in Conveying Information}\\
Colour significantly enhances the impact and comprehension of data visualisations. It serves multiple purposes: distinguishing data points, emphasising trends, and offering contextual information. It is utilised to encode categorical data, differentiating between various groups with distinct colours, and to represent quantitative data by using colour intensity or gradients to portray values or magnitudes. Additionally, color is instrumental in adding context to visualisations through background elements, labels, or annotations, imparting meaning to the data.\\

\noindent \textbf{Colour Perception and Colour Encoding in Visualisations}\\
Understanding color perception in data visualisation is crucial. Key principles involve considering color discrimination, ensuring accessibility for individuals with color vision deficiencies, as is illustrated by Figure~\ref{fig:colour-plot}. Careful selection of color schemes aligned with the intended message is essential—for instance, using warm colours like red and orange to indicate caution or warmth, and cool colours like blue and green to convey calmness or coldness. Additionally, attention should be paid to how colours interact when combined; certain combinations might create visual vibrations or impact text legibility, as was the case in the right plot of Figure~\ref{fig:messygraph}.\\

\begin{knitrout}\scriptsize
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.969, 0.969, 0.969}\color{fgcolor}\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\maxwidth]{figure/beamer-colour-plot-1} 

}

\caption[Colour perception of a heatmap for by a colour blind person]{Colour perception of a heatmap for by a colour blind person}\label{fig:colour-plot}
\end{figure}

\end{knitrout}

\noindent \textbf{Avoiding Misleading Visualisations Due to Colour Choices}\\
Misleading visualisations often stem from inappropriate or deceptive use of colour, requiring precautions to prevent such occurrences. First, maintaining consistency in colour usage throughout the visualisation is essential. Employing a uniform colour scheme for similar data categories or elements helps establish coherence and understanding. Furthermore, it's crucial to avoid colour choices that could distort or exaggerate the data. Overly intense or contrasting colours might mislead interpretations, emphasising the necessity for judicious colour selection.\\
Additionally, providing a clear and concise legend becomes imperative to explain the meaning of colours, especially when dealing with complex or unfamiliar colour schemes. A comprehensive legend helps viewers decipher the represented data accurately.\\


\subsection{Cognitive Load and Visual Complexity}
In data visualisation, achieving a balance between complexity and cognitive load is crucial. Cognitive load significantly influences how viewers engage with and comprehend presented data. Finding a balance is crucial to effectively convey information without overwhelming the viewer's cognitive capacity. This section explores the concept of cognitive load in visualisations, strategies to reduce cognitive load while maintaining complexity, and techniques to combat information overload through simplification.\\

\subsubsection{Strategies to Reduce Cognitive Load While Maintaining Complexity}
To reduce cognitive load while maintaining complexity in data visualisation, several strategies can be employed. Firstly, \textbf{establishing a clear visual hierarchy} using size, color, and contrast helps direct attention to crucial elements. Additionally, \textbf{simplifying labels and text} by avoiding unnecessary complexity ensures information is clear and easily digestible.\\
\noindent Furthermore, \textbf{employing interactive features} like tooltips and drill-down functionality assists in providing additional information when required, reducing the density of static visualisations. A final approach involves the use of \textbf{progressive disclosure}, presenting complex information gradually, beginning with an overview and allowing users to explore details as needed.\\

\begin{knitrout}\scriptsize

}

\caption[High vs low cognitive load demand through the reduction of visual complexity]{High vs low cognitive load demand through the reduction of visual complexity}\label{fig:cogload-plot}
\end{figure}

\end{knitrout}


\subsubsection{Information Overload and Simplification Techniques}
Addressing information overload in visualisations necessitates the strategic application of simplification techniques. Filtering enables focused data selection, while data reduction aggregates information to highlight overarching trends. Storyboarding structures data presentation, aiding in contextual comprehension, and prioritisation ensures critical information is prominently displayed, elevating the visualisation's clarity and impact. These strategies collectively combat overwhelming data or excessive visual elements, enhancing comprehension and the effective communication of insights to viewers.

\section{Modern Methods of Data Visualisation}

In this chapter, we explore a variety of powerful visualisation methods, from classic scatter plots and bar charts to advanced techniques like heatmaps and network graphs. Through vivid examples, we'll show when and why each method is used, and delve into the theoretical and mathematical foundations that empower these visualisations to unveil insights hidden within the data.

\subsection{Bar Charts and Histograms}
\subsubsection{Bar Charts}
A bar chart is a very important method to present data. It organizes information into vertical bars.  Bar charts have lots of advantages in data visualisation. It can present data categories in a frequency distribution. A bar chart is best for comparing classified data. Especially when the values are close, because the human perception of height is better than other visual elements (such as area, angle, etc.), the use of a bar chart is more appropriate. These bars usually have different lengths, and every length is proportional to the size of the information they present.\\

\noindent
R uses the function $barplot()$ to create bar charts. R can draw both vertical and Horizontal bars in the bar chart. In the bar chart, each of the bars can be given different colors.\\

\noindent
R is a programming language for data analysis and statistical computing, and its advent has made data visualisation more straightforward and accessible. Among the various tools available in R, ggplot2 stands out as one of the most renowned and powerful tools for creating data visualisations. It offers a wealth of data visualisation capabilities and is celebrated for its versatility and aesthetic appeal. In this chapter, we will focus on how to use ggplot2 to create bar charts for data visualisation.

\subsubsection{Different Types of Bar Charts}
Here is an overview of the different types of bar charts. \\

This is the most common bar chart. We use different vertical columns to display and compare the values of different categories in the same dimension, where the X-axis represents the contrasting categories and the Y-axis represents the frequency or count of their categories.\\
\paragraph{Horizontal Bar Chart}
This is very similar to a vertical bar chart but rotated 90 degrees. Categories are shown on the y-axis and frequency or count are shown on the x-axis. Horizontal bar charts are especially useful when category names are long or when there are numerous categories.
\paragraph{Multi-set Bar Chart}
Also known as a grouped bar chart or clustered bar chart. A multi-set bar chart is used to represent and compare different sub-groups within individual categories. This type of chart is useful when you want to show and compare multiple sets of data side-by-side.
Multi-set Bar charts can be horizontal or vertical like the other normal bar charts, and the length of each bar represents the frequency or count of their categories.
\paragraph{Stacked bar chart}
Similar to bar charts, stacked bar charts are often used to compare different classes of values and, within each class of values, are divided into sub-classes, which are often referred to by different colors. Each segment's size is proportional to the frequency or count that it represents from the sub-category. The entire bar's length represents the cumulative total of all the sub-categories.
However, it is very easy to get confused when there are too many categories.
Bar charts excel due to their structural simplicity, ease of comprehension, straightforward comparison of different data categories, and versatility for representing various data types and multilevel information

The disadvantages of bar charts include limited suitability for large datasets, potential misinterpretation when lacking a zero baseline, difficulty in handling numerous categories, and their preference for categorical data over continuous data trends, where line graphs are more suitable.

\subsubsection{ToothGrowth Dataset}

This bar chart below illustrates the tooth growth in relation to varying doses of a vitamin. The key observations are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{X-axis Description:} The X-axis represents different dosages of the vitamin (mg/day). There are three distinct dosage levels.
    
    \item \textbf{Y-axis Description:} The Y-axis signifies the length of tooth growth (len). This represents the average tooth growth at the given vitamin dosage.
    \item \textbf{Data Observation:} From the heights of the bars, it is evident that as the vitamin dosage increases, the tooth growth also appears to increase. This might suggest that higher doses of the vitamin may promote tooth growth.
\end{enumerate}

    \caption{Tooth Growth by Dose and Supplement (stacked bar chart)}
    \label{fig:barchart3}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\noindent
The displayed bar chart~\ref{fig:barchart2} provides insights into tooth growth influenced by varying doses of a vitamin, further categorized by the type of supplement (`supp`). The key insights from this chart are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{X-axis Description:} The X-axis demarcates different vitamin dosages, categorized into three distinct levels: 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day.
    \item \textbf{Y-axis Description:} The Y-axis quantifies tooth growth length, representing the combined average growth for both supplements at the respective vitamin dosages.
    \item \textbf{Data Observation:} The total height of each bar signifies the combined tooth growth for both supplements at the given dosage. From the stacked sections, it's evident that the impact on tooth growth varies based on the supplement type. A detailed inspection might elucidate the relative effectiveness of the supplements at each dosage level.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
The structure of the second figure~\ref{fig:barchart2} is quite similar to that of the first one, with the main difference lying in the method of data representation. Forming a bar chart, it facilitates the understanding of the combined effects of the two supplements at each dosage level. However, compared to the grouped bar chart, it becomes more challenging to differentiate the individual contributions of each supplement.\\

\noindent
In the next part of our section, we will look at another plot which called Histogram.

\subsubsection{Histograms}

Histograms, although visually similar to bar charts, convey different meanings. A histogram involves concepts of statistics. It requires data to be categorized into groups and then counts the data points within each of those groups. On a Cartesian coordinate system, the x-axis shows the endpoints of each group, and the y-axis represents frequency. The height of each rectangle indicates the corresponding frequency, making it a frequency distribution histogram. In order to determine the quantity of each group in the histogram, a multiplication of the frequency by the group interval is necessary. Since every histogram has a fixed group interval, if we use the y-axis to directly show quantity and each rectangle's height indicates the number of data points, we can both retain the distribution and simultaneously see the number in each group at a glance. All examples in this text use the non-standard histogram depiction with the y-axis denoting quantity.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Uses of Histograms:}
Histograms demonstrates the distribution of frequency or quantity across groups. Facilitates the visualisation of differences in frequency or quantity among groups. The R language uses the \texttt{hist()} function to create histograms. This function takes vectors as input and uses a few more parameters to plot the histogram.\\

\noindent
Now, we want to create a better graph with ggplot2 thanks to the \texttt{geom\_histogram()} function and iris dataset.

\subsubsection{Kernel Density Estimation}

Kernel Density Estimation(KDE) is an very useful tool in statistics. In stead of discrete histograms, it helps us to create a smooth curve given by a dataset. KDE is used to infer the distribution of a population based on a limited sample. Thus, the result of the kernel density estimation is an estimate of the sample's probability density function. Based on this estimated probability density function, we can ascertain certain characteristics of the data distribution, such as the regions where data is concentrated.\\

\noindent
The KDE algorithm takes a parameter, bandwidth, that affects how “smooth” the resulting curve is. Changing the bandwidth changes the shape of the kernel: a lower bandwidth means only points very close to the current position are given any weight, which leads to the estimate looking squiggly; a higher bandwidth means a shallow kernel where distant points can contribute.\\

\noindent
We can express KDE as follows,where the K represent the kernel function.
$$\hat{f}(x) = \sum_{\text{observations}} K\left(\frac{x - \text{observation}}{\text{bandwidth}}\right)$$
$$\hat{f}(x) = \frac{1}{nh} \sum_{i=1}^{n} K\left(\frac{x - x_i}{h}\right)$$\\
The kernel function \( K(u) \) is a normalized non-negative function that satisfies:
\[ \int K(u) \, du = 1 \]

\end{knitrout}
In figure~\ref{fig:kde3} we present the kernel density estimation of our dataset. The kernel density curve will display the distribution of sepal lengths. The peaks of the curve correspond to the main concentration trends of sepal length in the data. If the curve is unimodal, it means that the sepal lengths of most irises are concentrated in that region; if it is bimodal or multimodal, this indicates the presence of multiple such concentration areas.

\subsection{Scatter Plots and Bubble Charts}

Scatter plots and bubble charts are fundamental data visualisation techniques that provide valuable insights into the relationships and patterns within datasets. These visualisations are particularly effective for representing discrete data through data points, since this brings out easily identifiable comparisons, and reveals trends.

\subsubsection{Scatter Plots}

A scatter plot is a graphical representation of a set of data points in a two-dimensional coordinate system. Each data point is represented by a dot, and the position of the dot is determined by the values of two variables.\\

\noindent
In general, \(Y\) denotes the response variable and \(X\) denotes the explanatory variable. Let \((x_i, y_i)\) represent the coordinates of the \(i\)-th data point on the scatter plot. The scatter plot can be mathematically described as a set of points:

\[ \{(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)\} .\]
  
\noindent
Here, \(n\) is the number of observations in the set.\\


\subsubsection{Simple linear regression}
\\Regression models are statistical tools that provide functions to estimate the relationship between the response variable and one or more explanatory variables. Regression analysis is widely adopted by data scientists, who use large datasets to build predictive models for trend forecasting. The fol- lowing paragraphs will introduce simple linear regression models and demonstrate their usage using the mtcars dataset.
\\  
\\   
\noindent
\textbf{Theory of Simple Linear Regression}
\\  
\\Let $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)^T$ denote $n$ explanatory variables and let $\mathbf{Y} = (Y_1,Y_2,...,Y_n)^T$ denote $n$ corresponding response variables.
\\  
\\In a simple linear model, it is assumed that the response variables $Y_1,Y_2,...,Y_n$ are uncorrelated with a common variance $\sigma^2$, and their expectations are given by $E(Y_i| x_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i$. The expectations generated by $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ given $x_i$ can be expressed as:

$$\mathrm{E}(\mathbf{Y} | \mathbf{x}) =
\left( \begin{array}{ccc}
\beta_0+\beta_1 x_1\\
\beta_0+\beta_1 x_2\\
\vdots\\
\beta_0+\beta_1 x_n
\end{array} \right) = 
\left( \begin{array}{ccc}
1\\
1\\
\vdots\\
1
\end{array} \right) \beta_0 + 
\left( \begin{array}{ccc}
x_1\\
x_2\\
\vdots\\
x_n
\end{array} \right) \beta_1 =
\mathbf{1}_n \beta_0 + \mathbf{x} \beta_1 \cite{GRM_chp3},
$$ 
\noindent
where $\mathbf{1}_n$ is an n-vector of 1's.
\\  
\\Given design matrix $\mathbf{X}$ where $X_i = (1, x_i)$ and$\beta = (\beta_0, \beta_1)^T$, then $E(Y_i|x_i) = X_i \beta$. These assumptions can be equivalently written in the vector form:

\[\mathrm{E}(\mathbf{Y} | \mathbf{x}) = 
\left( \begin{array}{cc}
1 & x_1\\
1 & x_2\\
\vdots& \vdots\\
1 & x_n
\end{array} \right) 
\left( \begin{array}{cc}
\beta_0 \\
\beta_1
\end{array} \right) = \mathbf{X} \beta, \quad \text{and} \quad
\text{var}(\mathbf{Y} | \mathbf{x}) =
\begin{pmatrix}
\sigma^2 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & \sigma^2 & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \cdots & \sigma^2
\end{pmatrix} = \sigma^2 \mathbf{I}_n.
\]
\\  
\noindent
\textbf{Least Squares Estimation}\\

\noindent
The residual sum of squares (RSS) is a measure of the goodness of fit in a regression model, where residuals are the differences between the response variables $y_i$ and responses generated by the regression model $\mathrm{E}(\mathbf{Y}_i | \mathbf{x})$. In least squares estimation, the goal is to find values of parameters $\beta = (\beta_0, \beta_1)^T$ to minimise the RSS, denoted by $\mathrm{Q}$: 

\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Q} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} [y_i - \mathrm{E} (Y_i | \mathbf{x})]^2 
           = [\mathbf{y}- \mathrm{E} (\mathbf{Y} | \mathbf{x})]^{T} [\mathbf{y}- \mathrm{E} (\mathbf{Y} | \mathbf{x})] 
           = [\mathbf{y}- \mathbf{X} \beta]^{T} [\mathbf{y}- \mathbf{X} \beta],
\end{equation*}

\noindent
where $\mathbf{y}$ is n-vector of response variables and $\mathbf{X}$ is the $n \time 2$ design matrix. The partial derivative of $Q$ with respect to vector $\beta$ is:

$$\frac{\partial Q}{\partial \beta} = 2(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X}\beta - \mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{y})\cite{GRM_chp3},$$

\noindent
Equating $\frac{\partial Q}{\partial \beta} = \mathbf{0}$, the vector $\hat{\beta}$, the least squares estimate of $\beta$, can be written as:

$$\mathbf{X}^T(\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\hat{\beta})=\mathbf{0}.$$

\noindent 
The least squares estimate of $\beta$ is given by:
$$\hat{\beta} = (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{y}.$$

\\\textbf{Case example: 1970s automobiles}\\
\noindent
\\In this section, we will study the performance of 1970s automobiles using the mtcars dataset, employing the method of linear regression. Performance is measured in Miles per Gallon (mpg); the higher the mileage, the more efficient the automobile. We will start with the visualisation of a simple linear regression model, followed by the discussion of linear regression models and the model selection method.

\noindent
\\In the preliminary stages of data exploration, calculating the correlation matrix is a crucial step before engaging in regression modeling. The correlation matrix provides valuable insights into the relationships between different variables in the dataset. This is also important for understanding multicollinearity issues, which occur when covariates are highly correlated.

\noindent
\\Multicollinearity implies that the effects of individual covariates become intertwined. This intertwining can lead to erratic changes in the coefficient estimates of the regression model in response to small changes in the data. The accuracy of the model’s predictions is undermined by the instability of coefficients\cite{multicoli}.
\noindent
\\The correlation matrix of all variables in the mtcars dataset is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cor-matrix-mtcars2}.

\caption[Correlation matrix of variables in mtcars dataset]{Correlation matrix of variables in mtcars dataset}\label{fig:cor-matrix-mtcars2}
\end{figure}

\end{knitrout}
\noindent
\\For the simple linear regression model, the response variable is Miles per Gallon (mpg), and we select weight (wt) as the explanatory variable. Note that mpg and wt are highly correlated, with a correlation coefficient of -0.868. This suggests that wt may have strong predictive power for mpg. Use the R function \texttt{lm()} to calculate the linear regression model, with the summary displayed below.
\noindent
\\Observe that the t-test yields a p-value of $1.29 \times 10^{-10}$, which is less than $0.001$. This indicates that the variable wt holds high statistical significance in this model. For the fitted model, the slope is $\beta_1 = -5.3445$, meaning that for every increase of 1000 lbs, the car efficiency decreases by 5 miles per gallon. The simple linear regression line is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:scatter-plot}.\\

\noindent 
\\Model selection methods, such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), play a crucial role in statistical modeling. The R algorithm \texttt{step()}, which minimises the AIC score, aids in selecting the most appropriate regression model from a set of explanatory variables. Starting with all explanatory variables, the algorithm iteratively excludes one covariate at each step. This algorithm aims to find the best-fitting model by balancing goodness of fit and simplicity. It's important to note that \texttt{step()} provides comparison between models rather than an absolute measure of model quality.\\

\noindent
The procedure for selecting the best-fitted linear regression model using the \texttt{step()} algorithm is shown in Appendix A, where our best-fitted model is \texttt{formula = mpg \textasciitilde wt + qsec + am}. Given 10 explanatory variables, Miles per Gallon is best predicted by weight (wt), quarter-mile time (qsec), and Transmission (am), where 0 represents automatic and 1 represents manual.\\
\noindent

\subsubsection{Bubble Charts}
Bubble charts are a captivating data visualisation tool that extends beyond the typical two-dimensional scatter plot by introducing an extra dimension. They represent data points as bubbles or circles on a two-dimensional plane, where the size of each bubble encodes a third variable. This technique enhances data visualisation by facilitating the exploration of multivariate data and uncovering patterns that may be hidden in traditional scatter plots.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Bubble Chart's Utility in Visualising Data}\\

\noindent
Bubble charts excel in scenarios where three key variables need to be conveyed simultaneously. The x-axis and y-axis represent two variables, as in a standard scatter plot, while the size of the bubble encodes a third variable, often a quantitative one. This allows for the visualisation of relationships between three variables in a single, intuitive graphic.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Mathematical Intricacies of Bubble Charts}\\

\noindent
The mathematical intricacies of constructing bubble charts involve scaling the data values to determine the size of each bubble accurately. The size of the bubble is typically proportional to the square root of the variable it represents. The choice of scaling method depends on the data distribution and the message the chart aims to convey.\\

\noindent
The formula for calculating the bubble size (\(S\)) often involves applying a linear or nonlinear scaling function:

\[
S = k \cdot \sqrt{V},
\]

\\Where \(S\) represents the size of the bubble, \(V\) the value of the variable being represented, and \(k\) is a scaling factor to control the bubble size.\\

\noindent
Selecting an appropriate scaling factor (\(k\)) is critical for maintaining the proportionality between the bubble size and the variable being represented.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Bubble Charts in Practice}
This bubble chart visualises data from the same dataset as above. It depicts the relationship between car models and their fuel efficiency (mpg) while using the size of the bubbles to represent the car's horsepower (hp) and color-coding the bubbles based on the number of cylinders (cyl).

\textbf{Analysis of the bubble chart}\\

\noindent XXX


\subsection{Heatmaps, correlation matrix and AIC score}

The foundation of a heatmap is a data matrix $M$, where each entry in this matrix represents an observation:

$$M =
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
    M_{11} & M_{12} & \ldots & M_{1j} \\  
    M_{21} & M_{22} & \ldots & M_{2j} \\  
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\  
    M_{i1} & M_{i2} & \ldots & M_{ij}
\end{array}
\right].
$$

\noindent
Therefore, the first step to create a heatmap is to organise the data into columns and rows. In Figure~\ref{fig:fire-by-months-fy13-22}, the structured data is displayed as a grid of coloured cells, where the colour intensity corresponds to the underlying frequency.\\

\noindent
Heatmaps serve as powerful tools for visualising relationships between covariates within a model. An example of the necessity to analyse a matrix of correlations between variables is found in regression models. In the real world, variables are often correlated, and completely independent relationships are seldom encountered. Therefore, the analysis of pairwise correlations becomes essential. Significantly impacted by highly correlated covariates, the regression model requires the removal of one covariate from the set of covariates. The selection is based on the identification of a regression model with the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) score among these variables: 

$$AIC = -2 \l(\hat{\mathbf{\theta}})+2 \dim (\mathbf{\theta}),$$
\\where $\l(\hat{\mathbf{\theta}})$ is the log-likelihood function, which is used to find the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) of a distribution.\\

\noindent
The AIC measures the extent to which the linear model fits the dataset. To obtain the best model, minimise the AIC score. In other words, the objective is to have the trend explained by the regression model, while avoiding overfitting that captures the noise in the dataset, ultimately leading to inaccurate predictions.

\subsubsection{Heatmaps - Fire in Brazil}

The heatmap is a data visualisation technique that uses colour coding to represent different intensity.\\

\noindent
In this illustrative example, heatmaps are used to visualise fire occurrences in Brazil. These heatmaps provide a spatially coherent representation, highlighting regions at high risk and seasonal patterns. Here, the heatmap is a powerful tool for identifying the occurrence of fire incidents. The data-driven insights could empower policymakers to make informed decisions regarding preventive measures and firefighting strategies.\\

\noindent
In Figure~\ref{fig:spacetime-fy22}, it can be observed that significantly higher fire counts are found in certain locations. The presence of two strips with high frequencies of fires are highly unusual.  The vertical trend corresponds to the location of BR-230 (Trans-Amazonian Highway) passing through the city of Apuí, State of Amazonas, where a high frequency of fire occurrence is observed.  The horizontal trend corresponds to BR-163 (Brazil highway) passing through Três Pinheiros in Novo Progresso, State of Pará. The western coastal area with a high frequency of fire occurrence corresponds to regions in close proximity to the cities of Vista Alegre do Abunã and Rio Branco. Research has indicated that 95 \% of active fires and the most intense ones (FRP > 500 megawatts) occurred at the edges in forests.\\

\noindent
From the same figure, it can be observed that August and September are the riskiest months in terms of fire hazard, whereas little risk is posed from November to July. The follow-up question naturally arises: How does FY22 compare to previous years? Is it valid to claim that August and September constitute the fire hazard season?\\

\noindent
In Figure~\ref{fig:fire-by-months-fy13-22}, the data shows a higher number of fire occurrences in the months of August to October compared to the rest of the year, indicating a greater number of fire hazards during these months.

\subsection{Line Charts and Time Series Visualisation}

Line charts are fundamental tools in data visualisation, particularly useful for displaying time series data. A line chart represents $n$ data points 
$\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ on a Cartesian coordinate system, with the x-axis often denoting time intervals or ordered categories and the y-axis representing the measured values.\\ 

\noindent 
\textbf{Basics of Line Chart}\\

\noindent
In a line chart, consecutive data points are typically connected by straight lines. The line segment between two points \((x_i,y_i)\) and \((x_{i+1},y_{i+1})\) can be described by the equation of a line in the slope-intercept form: \(y=mx+b\), where \(m\) is the slope and \(b\) is the y-intercept. Also, a series of linear interpolations between pairs of data points could be used. These interpolations assume that the change between two points is uniform or linear. This linear approach is mathematically represented as:
\[
y = y_i + \frac{(y_{i+1} - y_i)}{(x_{i+1} - x_i)} \cdot (x - x_i) \quad \text{for} \quad x_i \leq x \leq x_{i+1}.
\]
\noindent
This equation highlights that for any point \(x\) between \(x_i\) and \(x_{i+1}\), the corresponding value of \(y\) on the line chart is determined by a linear relation. This method effectively ''fills the gaps'' between actual observed data points and provides a continuous view of the data.\\

\noindent 
\textbf{Time Series}\\

\noindent
Time series visualisation is particularly suited to line charts. A time series is a collection of observations $x_t$, where $t$ denotes the time point at which the observation is recorded. An index set $T_0$ which collects all the time points when observations are available. For instance, we often have $T_0 = \{0,1,2,...,n\}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$. By plotting these data points over time, line charts help in identifying long-term trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies.\\

\noindent
A time series can be viewed as a realisation of a stochastic process. And a stochastic process $X = (X_t)_{t \in T_0}$ is a collection of random variables $X_t$, where $t$ denotes the time index and $T_0$ the index set. For a fixed event $\omega \in \Omega$ we obtain the realisation of the stochastic process (sometimes also called a sample path) which is given by $x_t = X_t(\omega)$, $t \in T_0$. In practice, line charts of time series data provide insights into the behavior of such stochastic processes over time.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Time Series Visualisation of Exchange rates}\\

\caption{Daily and 49-day moving average exchange rates of CNY, CAN, EUR, HKD, USD to GBP}
\label{fig:all exchange rates}
\end{figure}

\noindent
The first plot in Figure~\ref{fig:all exchange rates} presents a comparative visualization of daily exchange rates for CNY, CAD, EUR, HKD, and USD against GBP, offering an overview of their trends and relative performance. This plot enables the identification of overall trends and periods of volatility for each currency pair, allowing for an assessment of their stability and strength relative to GBP. Usually, the long term trend attracts financial analyst most. Therefore, filtering fluctuations and anomalies is important. Then, a 49-day moving average (MA49) was employed, shown in the second plot of Figure~\ref{fig:all exchange rates}, to elucidate long-term trends while mitigating short-term fluctuations. This is mathematically represented as 
\[\text{MA}_{49}(t) = \frac{1}{49} \sum_{k=t-48}^{t} x_k,\] 
where \( x_k \) denotes the exchange rate on day $k$.\\

\noindent
This method effectively filters out daily noise, allowing a clearer view of overarching trends in currency movements against the GBP. The overlay of these moving averages on the daily exchange rates in visualizations provides both a clear comparative and a quantitative perspective.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Decomposition of Time Series}\\

\noindent
One of the primary advantages of time series visualisation is the ease with which it allows analysts to identify long-term upward or downward trends in data and patterns that repeat over specific intervals. By decomposing the time series, it would be easy to see those features.\\

\noindent
Time series data, $X_t$, can often be described as a combination of several distinct components: Trend component $t_t$: The underlying progression in the series, Seasonal component $s_t$: Periodic fluctuations due to seasonal factor, Residual $r_t$: The irregular or error component.\\

\noindent
The decomposition of a time series can be described in two main models:\\
\textbf{Additive Model}: In the additive model, the components are added together:
\[
X_t = t_t + s_t + r_t.
\]
\textbf{Multiplicative Model}: In the multiplicative model, the components are multiplied together:
\[
X_t = t_t \times s_t \times r_t \quad \text{or} \quad \log(X_t) = \log(t_t) + \log(s_t) + \log(r_t).
\]
In practice, the choice between the additive and multiplicative models often depends on the nature of the time series. If the magnitude of the seasonal fluctuations or the variation around the trend does not vary with the level of the time series, then an additive model is appropriate. If the magnitude of the seasonal fluctuations or the variation around the trend increases or decreases as the time series level changes, then a multiplicative model may be more suitable.\\

\noindent
In R, a built in function named "decompose()" is able to decompose the time series by addictive model or multiplicative model. And below is the demonstration of decomposition.

\caption{Decomposition of addictive time series model of CNY to GBP exchange rates}
\label{fig:decomposition of time series}
\end{figure}

\noindent
From Figure~\ref{fig:decomposition of time series}, the CNY to GBP exchange rate time series was decomposed into its fundamental components: trend, seasonality, and residual noise by additive model. This additive model, represented mathematically as $X_t = t_t + s_t + r_t$.\\

\noindent
As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:decomposition of time series}, the trend component $t_t$ reveals a gradual decrease in the CNY to GBP exchange rate over time, signifying a long-term depreciation of CNY against GBP. This trend is pivotal for understanding the broader economic relationship between these currencies.\\

\noindent
Moreover, the seasonal component $s_t$ of the decomposition highlights cyclical fluctuations, indicative of recurrent patterns within the year. These could be attributed to seasonal economic activities, policy changes, or other cyclical factors influencing the currency market. The clear demarcation of these cyclical trends in the seasonal component helps in isolating such effects from the overarching trend.\\

\noindent
Lastly, the residual component $r_t$ encompasses the random, unexplained variations after accounting for the trend and seasonal factors. Analyzing these residuals is crucial for understanding the unpredictability in the exchange rate and can be pivotal in risk management and forecasting.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Autocorrelation Analysis of CNY to GBP Exchange Rate}\\\\
Autocorrelation, also referred to as serial correlation, is a crucial concept in time series analysis. It describes the correlation of a time series with its own past and future values. The autocorrelation function (ACF) measures the linear predictability of the series at lag h, which is the time $t$ with its values at a previous time $t-h$. The mathematical fomulation of ACF of time series will be given in the following paragraph.\\

\noindent
Suppose we have a time series with observations denoted by \( x_1, \ldots, x_n \). Then the sample mean is given by $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n} x_t.$
And the sample autocovariance function at lag $h$ in days of our time series is
\[\hat{\gamma}(h) := \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n-|h|} (x_{t+|h|} - \bar{x})(x_t - \bar{x}), \quad \text{for} \; -n < h < n.\]
Hence, the sample autocorrelation function at lag $h$ in days is given by
\[\hat{\rho}(h) := \frac{\hat{\gamma}(h)}{\hat{\gamma}(0)} = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n-|h|} (x_{t+|h|} - \bar{x})(x_t - \bar{x})}{\sum_{t=1}^{n} (x_t - \bar{x})^{2}}, \quad \text{for} \; -n < h < n.\]
\noindent
The value of $\hat{\rho}(h)$ lies between -1 and +1. A value close to +1 indicates a strong positive correlation, while a value close to -1 indicates a strong negative correlation. A value near 0 suggests little to no linear correlation. A slow decay in the ACF plot indicates a strong relationship between past and present values, while spikes at specific lags may suggest seasonality. Autocorrelations outside the 95\% confidence interval are considered statistically significant.\\

\noindent
Next, visualise the ACF for the CNY to GBP exchange rate to understand its time-dependent structure better.

\caption{Autocorrelation Function at lag h in days of CNY to GBP Exchange Rate}
\label{fig:ACF}
\end{figure}

\noindent
From Figure~\ref{fig:ACF}, the ACF plot for the CNY to GBP exchange rate series reveals a compelling feature: the ACF starts near 1 and decreases gradually. This pattern suggests a strong persistence in the time series, indicating that past values have a significant influence on future values. In time series analysis, such a slow decay in the ACF is indicative of a non-stationary series, where the mean, variance, and autocorrelation structure do not remain constant over time.\\

\noindent
This persistent autocorrelation suggests that short-term movements in the CNY to GBP exchange rate are heavily influenced by its recent history. Such a characteristic is crucial for forecasting models, as it implies that recent historical data can be a powerful predictor of near-future trends. Models like ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average), which are well-suited for data with high autocorrelation, may be particularly effective in this context.



\subsection{Network Graphs}

\textbf{Definition and Utility:}
Network graphs, often referred to as graphs or networks, are a powerful data visualisation method used to depict relationships between entities. These entities, known as nodes, are interconnected by edges or links, which represent relationships, connections, or interactions. Network graphs find extensive utility in various fields, such as social network analysis, transportation systems, and even biological networks like protein-protein interactions. They excel at revealing complex dependencies and structures, making them a critical tool for understanding relational data.

\subsubsection{The Mathematics behind Network Graphs:}
Constructing network graphs involves several mathematical intricacies. Here we present just a few of the many concepts that play a role in the creation of such graphs:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Nodes and Edges}: Mathematically, a network graph, \(G\), is defined as \(G = (V, E)\), where \(V\) represents the set of nodes and \(E\) represents the set of edges connecting these nodes.
\item \textbf{Node Degree}: The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. In a directed graph, nodes can have both in-degrees and out-degrees.
\item \textbf{Centrality Measures}: Centrality metrics like degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality provide insights into the relative importance or influence of nodes within a network.
\item \textbf{Graph Metrics}: Graph theory concepts like shortest paths, connected components, and clustering coefficients are used toanalyse the network's structure.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\textbf{Formulas used in Network Graphs:}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Degree of a Node (Undirected Graph)}:
\[
\text{Degree}(v) = \sum_{w \in V} A(v, w)
\]
where \(A(v, w)\) is the adjacency matrix element, indicating whether there is a connection between nodes \(v\) and \(w\).
\item \textbf{Degree of a Node (Directed Graph)}:
\[
\text{In-Degree}(v) = \sum_{w \in V} A(w, v)
\]
\[
\text{Out-Degree}(v) = \sum_{w \in V} A(v, w)
\]
\item \textbf{Betweenness Centrality (for unweighted graphs)}:
\[
C_B(v) = \sum_{s \neq v \neq t} \frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}}
\]
where \(\sigma_{st}\) is the number of shortest paths from node \(s\) to \(t\), and \(\sigma_{st}(v)\) is the number of those paths passing through node \(v\).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Geographic Maps and Spatial Data Visualisation}

A \textbf{geographical maps} is a visual representation of an area—a symbolic depiction highlighting relationships between elements of that space, such as objects, regions, or themes. Maps have been used for centuries to navigate and explore the world, and they play a crucial role in understanding our environment, both locally and globally. These maps serve as canvases on which spatial data is painted, allowing for a visual comprehension of information that might otherwise remain abstract.\\

\noindent
Before moving on to the spatial data visualisation. It is essential to understand how we map the the earth on a plane. The Earth, a three-dimensional spheroid, can be transformed on a plane through map projections. Each projection offers a different way to "flatten" the Earth, and as a result, each has its strengths and distortions. For instance, the Mercator projection preserves angles but distorts areas as you move towards the poles. Beyond projections, coordinate systems, like the commonly used latitude and longitude, provide a standardized way to pinpoint any location on Earth.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Latitude} measures the angle between a point on the Earth's surface and the equator, moving north or south. And latitude values range from -90 degrees (South Pole) to +90 degrees (North Pole). The equator, which divides the Earth into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, is at 0 degree latitude.
\item \textbf{Longitude} measures the angle between a point on the Earth's surface and the prime meridian, moving east or west.
And longitude values range from -180 degrees to +180 degrees. The prime meridian, which is at 0 degree longitude, runs from the North Pole through Greenwich, England, to the South Pole. It divides the Earth into the Eastern and Western Hemispheres.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Together, lines of longitude and latitude create a grid system over the Earth's surface. By providing both a latitude and longitude value, one can specify an exact location on the Earth's surface. For example, the coordinates (0° N, 0° E) would indicate the intersection of the equator and the prime meridian, located in the Gulf of Guinea off the west coast of Africa.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Spatial data visualisation}\\

\noindent
Spatial data visualisation are powerful tools that transform raw, often complex datasets into visual representations, revealing patterns, relationships, and insights rooted in location. At their core, maps provide a spatial context, allowing us to see the world's intricate web of interconnectedness. Today, with the surge in big data and advanced visualisation tools, spatial data visualisation is not just about presenting information but also about telling compelling stories, guiding decision-making, and predicting future trends based on geographical patterns.

\noindent
From Figure~\ref{fig:London Wards Map}, we are introduced to a detailed layout of all wards within Greater London, pinpointed by their geographical coordinates. While this map provides a clear depiction of location and boundaries, it offers limited insight into the dynamics of crime distribution.\\

\noindent
Hence, we will use a more informativevisualisation: a choropleth map showcasing crime rates by borough. Here, crime rates are calculated by dividing the total crime count in each borough by its respective population as of 2020. This per capita approach normalizes the data, ensuring comparability across boroughs with different population sizes.

\caption{Crime rate by boroughs in London in 2020}
\label{fig:crime rate london}
\end{figure}

\noindent
From Figure~\ref{fig:crime rate london}, Westminster stands out, labeled in red, indicating a higher crime rate. This visual marker highlights Westminster as an area of particular concern regarding criminal activity. This could be attributed to factors like its status as a central, densely populated area with significant tourist traffic and commercial activity, which often correlate with higher crime rates.\\

\noindent
In contrast, the map reveals a trend where rural or less densely populated areas tend to be safer, as evidenced by their lighter coloration. These areas typically experience lower crime rates, possibly due to factors such as smaller populations, less anonymity for potential offenders, and different socio-economic dynamics compared to urban centers.\\

\noindent
The choropleth map of London’s crime rates elucidates key spatial patterns in crime distribution. It highlights the variance in crime rates from urban centers to rural areas, accentuating the higher crime rates in central, densely populated areas like Westminster, depicted in red, compared to the lighter shades marking safer, rural boroughs. This visual tool facilitates an understanding of how urbanization, socio-economic status, and population density impact crime rates across the boroughs.

\subsection{3D and Interactive Visualisations}

ggplot2 is one of the most popular data visualisation libraries in R, but it is primarily designed for 2D data visualisation. Directly creating 3D views with ggplot2 can be challenging.\\

\noindent
R provides several packages for 3Dvisualisation, such as rgl, plot3D, rayshader, and others, which are specifically designed for three-dimensional data. These packages offer the capability to create 3D scatter plots, surface plots, heat maps, contour maps, and more.\\

\noindent
\textbt{rgl}: This is one of the most popular R packages for creating interactive 3D charts. It supports various types of 3D graphics including points, lines, and surfaces, and allows users to interactively rotate, zoom, and pan the view.\\
\textbt{scatterplot}：This package provides a function to create 3D scatter plots. It does not support interactive manipulation, but the generated graphics are well-suited for display in static reports.\\

\noindent
3D data visualisation is an approach that employs three-dimensional graphics to represent complex data structures, allowing for an immersive exploration of information. Unlike traditional 2D visualisations (like bar graphs or line charts), 3D visualisations can convey an additional dimension of data, making them particularly valuable in specific contexts.\\

\noindent
Our first example will be  a scatter plot. We can use scatterplot3d package to help us for data visualisation.
