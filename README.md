# Data-Visualisation-Project
Data Visualisation: Theory and Practise

Undergraduate Mathematics Project
Supervised by Dr. Miguel de Carvalho

This project aims to provide the theory of graphical statistics methods and their visual implementations using R, utilising open-source datasets from different sectors. The authors recognise that graphical statistics is an active area of research, therefore textbook methods and state-of-the-art methods are covered. While Chapter 2 focuses on the theoretical framework of data visualisation, Chapters 3 to 5 concentrate on standard implementations of graphical statistics methods for univariate, bivariate, and multivariate data, respectively. Chapter 6 focuses on functional boxplots and Qâ€“Q boxplots, which were published in the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics in 2011 and 2022, respectively.
